A Native Android app to help you memorize passages using fill in the blanks!

## Launcher/Store App Icons

You can find the master icon used to generate all the iOS/Android variations in `/non_code_icons/`. There you can also find the app icons used for the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. All these icons in this folder are not actually used in the code, I just keep them in the repo so they're easy to find. As for the icons that are generated from the icon and used directly in the app in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap*`.
